ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @LauraLyckholm, or in human words: Laura!
I'm here to learn, get inspired, and hopefully also share my projects with the world.  

ðŸ‘€ I love being creative, in what way doesn't really matter! In my day-to-day work I get to be creative on the web, by designing and creating different types of content on an e-commerce website. 
However, when I have time of, I like spending it trying all sorts of new creative outlets, like pottery, painting, sewing, fiddling in Photoshop or Home Assistant and much more. 
I'm also and extreme problem-solver. Give me, or hint about, a problem -  and I'm there for you. I like making it my task in life to help people in making life easier, or smoother.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front-End Development at Technigo. I'm so very ready to be more than 'just' a Web Designer, and by Januari 2024, I hope this will be my life. 
On my free time, I'm also learning to landscape around my new house, and playing around in and supporting our Home Assistant domain.

ðŸ“« You can reach me by hopping over to my Linkedin-page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauralyckholm/) or by sending me an e-mail on laura.lyckholm@gmail.com.
